# House_price_visualizations
A dataset that Iâ€™m interested in is the house data which derived from data in the cities of the state of Washington USA from May1' to July 9', 2014. It includes information such as: date, price, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, square feet living, square feet lot, the number of floors, square feet above, square feet basement, year built, year renovated, street, city, state zip. There are 4600 homes in the data set.

I think to decide for buying, selling or holding a home, we should understand the trend of the house price in the real estate market cycle and figure out factors that we need to take into consideration. Since if the asking price is too high, the likelihood of the home being sold greatly decreases. On the other hand, if a home we are looking to sell is priced too low, we'll miss out on potential profits. Therefore, my goal is to find out the fair value of the property, know the trend of the house price in the period and how those attributes such as: the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, or square feet living, year built, year renovated affect to the house price.
